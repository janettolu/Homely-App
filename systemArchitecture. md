# Homely — System Architecture

## High level overview
Homely is a web and mobile platform that connects renters with verified landlords, agents and artisans
It provides a transparent, traceable, and convenient rentals experience while digializing Nigeria's informal housing market.

Homely is built with three main components:

## Frontend
Purpose: Displays all user interfaces (Renters, Agents, and Landlords)
Tech Stack: 
- React Native for mobile (single codebase iOS/Android)
- React.js for web
Responsibilities:
- authorization, user registration and login
- listing and agent profile browsing
- chat UI and scheduling
- Filtering homes by location, prce and type

## Backend
Purpose: Handles logic, authentication, and communication between frontend and database
Tech Stack:
- Node.js + Express
- Auth: JWT + refresh tokens
APIs:
  - /auth, /users, /agents, /listings, /bookings, /payments, /chat
- Real-time: Socket.io service for chat and live viewing updates

## Database
Purpose: Stores all user and property information
Tech Stack:
- PostgreSQL (primary)
Data Stored: 
- Users profiles
- Agents
- Listings (photos, price, location)
- Bookings and chat history
- Payments
- Reviews and ratings
- Artisan details
Use PostGIS for location queries (optional)

## Third-party services
- Map API (Google map)
- Payment provider (Flutterwave, paystack)
- SMS/OTP (Twilio or local provider)
- Identity verification (ID upload + manual or third-party KYC)

## 3. System Communication Flow
- User interacts with the Frontend (e.g., searches for a house).
- The Frontend sends a request to the Backend API (Node.js).
- The Backend fetches data from the Database (MongoDB).
- The Backend returns the filtered results to the Frontend.
- The Frontend displays listings, agents, or booking info to the user.


## Deployment
- Containerized apps (Docker)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Hosting: AWS (ECS/EC2) or Vercel for web
- Backups: daily DB snapshots

## Security & Feasibility
- Data encryption at rest & transit (HTTPS/TLS)
- Rate limiting, input validation, role-based access
- Feasible because stacks are standard, scalable patterns, and third-party services reduce build time.
